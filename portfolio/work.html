                            <li>The reason to go for multi-platform detection rather than deliberately shipping any one version of the app with a specific player controller, is because Desktop and Mobile can enable VR.</li>

                            <li>The user interaface has to change based on the platform as well, being a screen overlay for PC and Mobile, but going into world space ethereal screens while in VR.</li>

                                Being given the chance to get paid while doing it was quite a dream come true.</li>
                            <li>Although not my first time dealing with multiplayer, this was the first time I had to deal with object ownership during player interactions, a humbling experience.</li>
                            <li>Designing UI capable of switching between VR and non-VR platforms was a challenge. Although the solution I came up with in this project works, it is ultimately a pain to setup any UI with it.</li>
                            <li>The project ultimately ended up being a pitch piece due to a lack of demand.</li>

                            <li>With my responsibility to work on the front-end, it became my call for what parts of the code had to be removed, and what could be kept to integrate with what I bring in.</li>
                            <li>Initially, the scene setup, object scaling, and player interaction code was a mess, and had to be overhauled.</li>
                            <li>Overall this project was remarkably similar to the ASTAR VMF project, aside from being a web application. I took it as an opportunity to refine part of what I had worked on in the previous project.</li>
                            <li>The player controls for PC and Mobile are much more intuitive even compared to my old work.</li>
