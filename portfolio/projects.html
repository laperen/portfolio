                            <li>The project started as a Unity plugin, but functionality overscoped to the point Unity Editor Scripting became a hinderance.</li>
                            <li>After breaking the project away from Unity, it became a way for me to learn web development.</li>
                            <li>As my familiarity with web development grew, so did the features I envisioned for this tool.</li>
                            <li>Creating teaching tools too early was a mistake, since they very quickly became outdated as this tool evolved.</li>
                            <li>While there was consideration to make this a server based application, I ultimately did not want to deal with account management, at least not yet.</li>

                            <li>The win condition is the same as connect 4; get at minimum 4 of the same color in a row, be it horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
                            <li>The mix up is, every token has 1 of 3 different symbols on them. If a minimum of 3 tokens in a row, horizontally or vertically, have the same symbol, they are removed from the game as per match 3 rules.</li>
                            <li>Can be played <a href="./m3c4/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, against an AI, or turn by turn with a friend.</li>

                        <h2>Trials and Tribulations</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This was my first actual web project, made for the purpose of learning web development, in as full a capacity as I could reach alone.</li>
                            <li>There was an online multiplayer version, since removed because I have not found a new free host for my NodeJS server, after <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroku</a> changed their terms of service, essentially eliminating all their free users.</li>
                            <li>Learning anything for the first time is challenging, although things felt especially obtuse with CSS, at least initially. Comparitively, I used my experience in Unity C# to springboard my education in JavaScript.</li>
                            <li>Learning to delay actions with Asyncs, Awaits, and timers, allowing players to make sense of the results of actions. Stepping away from a game engine's update loop was an interesting experience, getting me to understand time is what I make of it in a project of my own making.</li>
                            <li>The enemy AI was especially interesting, learning of a technique to simulate actions and score them against each other, in order to find the optimal action to take. For anything complex, I would expect this technique to require heavy abstraction of complex data, to run simulations at a reasonable rate.</li>
